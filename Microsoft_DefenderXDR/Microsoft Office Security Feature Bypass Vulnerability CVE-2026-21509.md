**Microsoft Office Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability CVE-2026-21509**

Microsoft disclosed CVE-2026-21509 an important vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass Office security protections when a user opens a malicious document (🔗 in the comments). Exploitation has already been observed in the wild.
This mainly affects Office 2016 and 2019, which are still widely used.

✅ How to reduce the risk:

- Install the January 2026 security updates for Office 2016 / 2019
- If patching is delayed, apply the recommended registry mitigation to block the vulnerable COM/OLE control. (Microsoft 365 Apps and newer Office versions are protected via service-side mitigations (restart required)

Even “non-critical” Office vulnerabilities matter — a single document can be enough to trigger an attack.
