**New KSMBD DoS (CVE-2025-38501) can exhaust SMB connections via half-open TCP handshakes**

**Description:**  New KSMBD DoS (CVE-2025-38501) can exhaust SMB connections via half-open TCP handshakes â€” patch to Linux 6.1.15+ or rate-limit TCP/445 to mitigate.
This KQL query helps to hunt for connection attempts to port 445 across Linux endpoints in Defender XDR.

```
DeviceInfo
| where OSPlatform has "Linux"
| join kind=inner ( DeviceNetworkEvents) on $left.DeviceId == $right.DeviceId
| where RemotePort == 445
| extend Geo_ip = tostring(geo_info_from_ip_address(RemoteIP).country)
| summarize Connection_Attempts=count() by RemoteIP,Geo_ip,RemotePort, DeviceId, DeviceName
| order by Connection_Attempts
```
