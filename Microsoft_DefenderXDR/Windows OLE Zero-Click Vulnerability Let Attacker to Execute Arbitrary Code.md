**Critical Windows OLE Zero-Click Vulnerability Let Attacker to Execute Arbitrary Code**

**Description:** A serious security flaw, tracked as CVE-2025-21298, has been found in Microsoft's Windows OLE technology.
This zero-click bug, rated 9.8 on the CVSS scale, lets attackers remotely run malicious code by targeting Microsoft Outlook and other appsâ€”no user interaction needed.

The issue lies in how a specific function handles OLE objects inside RTF files. Attackers can take advantage of this by sending a malicious email with an RTF attachment. Just opening or even previewing the email in Microsoft Outlook is enough to trigger the exploit, letting attackers run code on the system without any user action needed.

This KQL Query helps to detect emails received with a .RTF file attached. It includes the option to whitelist some TrustedDomains to avoid False Positives.
```
EmailAttachmentInfo
| where FileName endswith ".rtf"
| join kind=inner (EmailEvents) on $left.NetworkMessageId == $right.NetworkMessageId
| extend Geo_IP = tostring(geo_info_from_ip_address(SenderIPv4).country)
| where SenderMailFromDomain !in ("trusteddomain1","trusteddomain2")
| summarize make_set(RecipientEmailAddress) by SenderDisplayName, SenderFromAddress, SenderIPv4,Geo_IP, FileName, Subject
```
