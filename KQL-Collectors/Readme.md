<h1>IOC Collection into MISP</h1>

This Project is  focus on collect IoC that has been already observed into DefenderXDR. Once they are collected using different KQL Queries, they will be added into MISP, and other possibilities such as Microsoft Defender TI Indicators.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
Azure App Registration with the role ThreatHunting.Read.All.

Key Vault repository with 3 secrets:

  - TenantID
  - AppRegistrationID
  - AppRegistrationSecret
  
3. Logic Apps

<h2>App Registration</h2>

1. Navigate to App Registration into Microsoft Azure and click onâ€˜ New Registrationâ€™:

3. Once the App Registration is created, navigate to API Permissions blade on the left. For every permission added into the following table, is required to follow the next steps(ðŸš¨ThreatIndicators.ReadWrite.OwnedBy is just required if you are going to integrate the process with Defender TI Indicators):

| Microsoft Graph                         | Type         | Description                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| APIConnectors.ReadWrite.All             | Application  | Read and write API connectors for authentication flows        |
| ThreatHunting.Read.All                  | Application  | Run hunting queries                                           |
| ThreatIndicators.ReadWrite.OwnedBy     | Application  | Manage threat indicators this app creates or owns             |
| User.Read                               | Delegated    | Sign in and read user profile                                 |

Once is created, save the Value Secret which will be copied into KeyVault in the next step.

<h2>Key Vault</h2>

|---|

Once there, click on Generate and create the 3 secrets for the following values:

- TenantID
- AppID
- Secret Generated on the App Registration

<h2>Logic Apps</h2>
For the Logic Apps implementation you have 2 options:
1. Use the LogicApp_MISP_.json template
   Oriented to collect different IOCS from DefenderXDR and add them into MISP
2. Use the LogicApp_MISP_TIIndicator_.json template
   Oriented to
