**Monitoring M.Teams activities such as shared URLs, OneToOne chats and Domains participating into meetings**

New day, new KQL query, this time oriented to identify Microsoft Teams activities such as:

- URL's shared into Teams Chat or Channels (Case 1)
- Domains participating into Teams meetings or channels (Case 2)
- One to One Chats which can be related to scam (bad actors contact you by Teams externally to request info or saying that they are part of support team, reported case in a recent event ðŸŽ¤ ) (Case 3)
- Identify non-compliance or non-allowed Teams Channels/Groups names
