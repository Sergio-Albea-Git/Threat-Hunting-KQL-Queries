ErrorCode,Description
16000,InteractionRequired - User account '{EmailHidden}' from identity provider '{idp}' doesn't exist in tenant '{tenant}' and can't access the application '{appid}'({appName}) in that tenant.

This error is fairly common when you try to sign in to Microsoft Entra admin center by using personal Microsoft Account and no directory associated with it.
16001,UserAccountSelectionInvalid - You see this error if the user selects on a tile that the session select logic has rejected. When triggered this error allows the user to recover by picking from an updated list of tiles/sessions or by choosing another account. This error can occur because of a code defect or race condition.
16002,AppSessionSelectionInvalid - The app-specified SID requirement wasn't met.
160021,AppSessionSelectionInvalidSessionNotExist - Application requested a user session that doesn't exist. This issue can be resolved by creating new Azure account.

500011,InvalidResourceServicePrincipalNotFound - The resource principal named {name} wasn't found in the tenant named {tenant}. This can happen if the application hasn't been installed by the administrator of the tenant or consented to by any user in the tenant. You might have sent your authentication request to the wrong tenant. If you expect the app to be installed you might need to provide administrator permissions to add it. Check with the developers of the resource and application to understand what the right setup for your tenant is.
500014,InvalidResourceServicePrincipalDisabled - The service principal for resource '{identifier}' is disabled. This indicates that a subscription within the tenant has lapsed or that an administrator for this tenant has disabled the application's service principal preventing tokens from being issued for it. For more information see Disable user sign-in for application.
500021,Access to '{tenant}' tenant is denied. 500021 indicates that the tenant restriction feature is configured and that the user is trying to access a tenant that isn't in the list of allowed tenants specified in the header Restrict-Access-To-Tenant. For more information see Use tenant restrictions to manage access to SaaS cloud applications.

To learn more see the troubleshooting article for error 50011.
50012,AuthenticationFailed - Authentication failed
50013,InvalidAssertion - Assertion is invalid because of various reasons - The token issuer doesn't match the API version within its valid time range -expired -malformed - Refresh token in the assertion isn't a primary refresh token. Contact the app developer.

50014,GuestUserInPendingState - The user account doesn’t exist in the directory. An application likely chose the wrong tenant to sign into and the currently logged in user was prevented from doing so since they didn't exist in your tenant. If this user should be able to sign in add them as a guest. For further information please visit add B2B users.
50015,ViralUserLegalAgeConsentRequiredState - The user requires legal age group consent.
50017,CertificateValidationFailed - Certification validation failed
50020,UserUnauthorized - Users are unauthorized to call this endpoint.

500208,The domain is not a valid login domain for the account type - This situation occurs when the user's account does not match the expected account type for the given tenant.

50033,RetryableError - Indicates a transient error not related to the database operations.
50034,UserAccountNotFound - To sign into this application the account must be added to the directory. This error can occur because the user mis-typed their username or isn't in the tenant. An application might have chosen the wrong tenant to sign into and the currently logged in user was prevented from doing so since they did not exist in your tenant. If this user should be able to log in add them as a guest. See docs here: Add B2B users.
50042,UnableToGeneratePairwiseIdentifierWithMissingSalt - The salt required to generate a pairwise identifier is missing in principle. Contact the tenant admin.

50076,UserStrongAuthClientAuthNRequired - Due to a configuration change made by the admin such as a Conditional Access policy per-user enforcement or because you moved to a new location the user must use multifactor authentication to access the resource. Retry with a new authorize request for the resource.
50078,UserStrongAuthExpired- Presented multifactor authentication has expired due to policies configured by your administrator. You must refresh your multifactor authentication to access '{resource}'.
50079,UserStrongAuthEnrollmentRequired - Due to a configuration change made by the admin such as a Conditional Access policy per-user enforcement or because the user moved to a new location the user is required to use multifactor authentication.

50136,RedirectMsaSessionToApp - Single MSA session detected.
50139,SessionMissingMsaOAuth2RefreshToken - The session is invalid due to a missing external refresh token.

51004,UserAccountNotInDirectory - The user account doesn’t exist in the directory. An application likely chose the wrong tenant to sign into and the currently logged in user was prevented from doing so since they did not exist in your tenant. If this user should be able to log in add them as a guest. For further information please visit add B2B users.
51005,TemporaryRedirect - Equivalent to HTTP status 307 which indicates that the requested information is located at the URI specified in the location header.

650056,Misconfigured application. This could be due to one of the following: the client has not listed any permissions for '{name}' in the requested permissions in the client's application registration. Or the admin has not consented in the tenant. Or check the application identifier in the request to ensure it matches the configured client application identifier. Or check the certificate in the request to ensure it's valid. Please contact your admin to fix the configuration or consent on behalf of the tenant. Client app ID: {ID}. Please contact your admin to fix the configuration or consent on behalf of the tenant.
650057,Invalid resource. The client has requested access to a resource which isn't listed in the requested permissions in the client's application registration. Client app ID: {appId}({appName}).

90055,TenantThrottlingError - There are too many incoming requests. This exception is thrown for blocked tenants.
90056,BadResourceRequest - To redeem the code for an access token the app should send a POST request to the /token endpoint. Also prior to this you should provide an authorization code and send it in the POST request to the /token endpoint. Refer to this article for an overview of OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow. Direct the user to the /authorize endpoint which will return an authorization_code. By posting a request to the /token endpoint the user gets the access token. Check App registrations > Endpoints to confirm that the two endpoints were configured correctly.
900561,BadResourceRequestInvalidRequest - The endpoint only accepts {valid_verbs} requests. Received a {invalid_verb} request. {valid_verbs} represents a list of HTTP verbs supported by the endpoint (for example POST) {invalid_verb} is an HTTP verb used in the current request (for example GET).

90072,PassThroughUserMfaError - The external account that the user signs in with doesn't exist on the tenant that they signed into, so the user can't satisfy the MFA requirements for the tenant. This error also might occur if the users are synced but there is a mismatch in the ImmutableID (sourceAnchor) attribute between Active Directory and Microsoft Entra ID. The account must be added as an external user in the tenant first. Sign out and sign in with a different Microsoft Entra user account.
